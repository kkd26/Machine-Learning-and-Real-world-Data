# Machine-Learning-and-Real-world-Data

This is a course taught at University of Cambridge. I want to present my implementations of the machine learning and data analysis algorithms.

## Aims
This course introduces machine learning algorithms as used in real-world applications, and the experimental methodology necessary to perform statistical analysis of large-scale data from unpredictable processes. It consists of 3 extended practicals, as follows:

- Statistical classification: Determining movie review sentiment using Naive Bayes (7 sessions);
- Sequence Analysis: Hidden Markov Modelling and its application to a task from biology (predicting protein interactions with a cell membrane) (4 sessions);
- Analysis of social networks, including detection of cliques and central nodes (5 sessions).

## Syllabus
- Topic One: Statistical Classification [7 sessions].
  Introduction to sentiment classification.
  Naive Bayes parameter estimation.
  Statistical laws of language.
  Statistical tests for classification tasks.
  Cross-validation and test sets.
  Uncertainty and human agreement.
- Topic Two: Sequence Analysis [4 sessions].
  Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and HMM training.
  The Viterbi algorithm.
  Using an HMM in a biological application.
- Topic Three: Social Networks [5 sessions].
  Properties of networks: Degree, Diameter.
  Betweenness Centrality.
  Clustering using betweenness centrality.

## Objectives
  
By the end of the course you should be able to:
- understand and program two simple supervised machine learning algorithms;
- use these algorithms in statistically valid experiments, including the design of baselines, evaluation metrics, statistical testing of results, and provision against overtraining;
- visualise the connectivity and centrality in large networks;
- use clustering (i.e., a type of unsupervised machine learning) for detection of cliques in unstructured networks.
