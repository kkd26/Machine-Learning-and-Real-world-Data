## Task 1 - Training the HMM

Your aim is to calculate the parameters (transition and emission matrices) of the HMM which you will use to predict when the dice is switched between fair and loaded.

## Usage

Unpack `data.tar.gz` file and move it to `Hidden Markov Models` directory and enjoy my code in `java.uk.ac.cam.kkd26.exercises`. More details are described in `task7.pdf`.
