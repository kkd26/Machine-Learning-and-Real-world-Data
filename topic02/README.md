# Hidden Markov Models

## Task 7 - Training the HMM

Your aim is to calculate the parameters (transition and emission matrices) of the HMM which you will use to predict when the dice is switched between fair and loaded.

## Task 8 - Viterbi Algorithm

Complete Viterbi Algorithm which can predict the hidden chain when given an observed sequence and Marcov model (trained in task 7).

## Task 9 - Biological applications

This practical explores the application of Hidden Markov models to biological data. Building a Hidden Markov Model of the amino acid sequences and to predict hidden states using the Viterbi algorithm.

## Usage

Unpack `data.tar.gz` file and move it to `Hidden Markov Models` directory and enjoy my code in `java.uk.ac.cam.kkd26.exercises`. More details are described in `task[7-9].pdf`.
