# Sotial Networks

## Task 10 - Properties of Networks

Loading graph from file, calculating the degree of each node, calculating diameter of the network.

## Task 11 - Betweenness

Use Brandes' algorithm to calculate the Betweenness Centrality for each node in the graph.

## Task 12 - Clustering

Calculate number of edges in the graph, calculate connected components using DFS, calculate edge betweenness usign Brandes algorithm and finally perform Girvan-Newman clustering algorithm.

## Usage

Unpack `data.tar.gz` file and move it to `Social Networks` directory and enjoy my code in `java.uk.ac.cam.kkd26.exercises`. More details are described in `task[10-12].pdf`.
